			<p>I'm Molly Williams, a journalism and creative writing student at the University of Maryland, College
				park. Read on to learn a little bit more about me, inside and outside the classroom.</p>

			<p>I plan to use my education to pursue a career in audio broadcasting, specifically radio or
				podcasting. Through my classes and activities, I have extensively explored topics related to music
				through research and, most recently, an upcoming radio hour for Maryland's university station, WMUC.
			</p>

			<p>I have been writing for most of my life, which is what drew me to Journalism and creative writing in
				college. Over the past few years, I have written a number of short stories in Maryland's writing
				workshops. I am well-versed in the writing and workshopping process as a result, and am able to use
				these skills in all the different types of writing required for my coursework and extracurricular
				activities.</p>
