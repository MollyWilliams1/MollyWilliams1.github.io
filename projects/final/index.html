                <p>For nearly two decades, it has slowly risen in popularity. </p>
                <p>It has introduced us to great music, told us incredible stories and taught us countless new things.
                </p>
                <p>A 2006 program forebodingly titled “The End of Radio” said that traditional radio had this medium
                    “nipping at its heels.”</p>
                <p> The question that people have been asking for almost 20 years is just as relevant today as it was
                    then: Will there come a day where podcasting completely takes over the world of audio broadcasting?
                </p>
                <p>The simple answer is no, at least not in the way we may think.</p>
                <p>The result of a steady decrease in radio listeners and a rapid increase in podcast listeners is
                    slowly evolving into a marriage between the two mediums. </p>
                    <p class="end-text">As the numbers steadily creep toward meeting in the middle, the future of the audio industry is a bit of a mystery.</p>

                    <p>“I have seen many, many times the predicted death of radio,” said Steven Drummond, Executive Producer at National Public Radio (NPR).</p>
                    <p>Drummond has worked at NPR for 21 years and has seen the audio broadcast medium change significantly throughout his career. To him, podcasting and radio have their own strengths, radio being more immediate and podcasting being more niche. The past few years have shown how listenership can be affected by what is going on in the world. </p>
                    <p>For example, Drummond said that NPR saw an increase in radio listeners during the Trump Administration since people were eager for information about what might be happening. </p>
                    <p>Conversely, the COVID-19 pandemic caused daily radio listenership to decrease for reasons as simple as people not commuting to work anymore. </p>
                    <p>Drummond also spoke to the generational aspect of this conversation, saying that young people are less likely to tune into a radio show at a certain time.</p>

                    <p class="caption">Different mediums make up the broad category of audio broadcasting. Here, we can see which formats make up listenership as a whole. Data collected by NPR and Edison Research.</p>
                    <p>“The line between radio and podcasting is a lot blurrier than it once was,” he explained. He then posed the question of whether or not the ability to say “Alexa, play NPR News” can really be categorized as radio or podcasting.</p>
                    <p>This way of consuming audio is sort of a combination of the best aspects of radio and podcasting. When everything is at our fingertips, we can benefit from the immediacy of radio and the convenience of podcasting.</p>
                    <p>In today’s world, there is still a market for traditional radio. NPR and the Pew Research Center have conducted many studies that show a slowly decreasing yet still significant audience. As this format joins podcasting in a complementary relationship, the world of audio broadcasting continues to persevere.</p>
                    <p>While radio as we perceive it may change, there will always be a place for it in some way, shape or form. The audio medium is, like every aspect of the journalism industry, constantly adapting and evolving. Our need to listen is one that will not altogether fade, and our desire to listen is what will ultimately keep radio alive.</p>
